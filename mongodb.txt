I have created a new user with name flori and password ABC.
This is how to connect with mongosh:

mongosh "mongodb+srv://flori:ABC@cluster0.p9bpe.mongodb.net/"

mongod.exe --dbpath=".\data\db"

to start the server

then

mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017"

to connect

Tutorial is here: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/

then
use mydatabase;

Write the script testinsert.js with content

db.movies.insertOne(
    {
      title: "The Favourite",
      genres: [ "Drama", "History" ],
      runtime: 121,
      rated: "R",
      year: 2018,
      directors: [ "Yorgos Lanthimos" ],
      cast: [ "Olivia Colman", "Emma Stone", "Rachel Weisz" ],
      type: "movie"
    }
  )

  then
  load("testinsert.js");

  then
  db.movies.find();
